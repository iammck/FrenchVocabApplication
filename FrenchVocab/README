This is an exercise in the ListFragment, SQLiteDatabe, ContentProvider, SimpleCursorAdapter and 
CursorLoader Classes for the android. The application should display a list view and allow the 
user to interact with it. The back end of the ListFragment should be a cursorAdapter to a 
SQLiteDatabase.

The initial commit came with some code.
